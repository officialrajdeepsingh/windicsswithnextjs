In this demo, I used WindiCSS with Next.js. Windicss is based on typescript and similar to tailwind CSS. If you used tailwindmcss then windicss is almost the same and you can easily shift.

All the HTML Template used from https://tailblocks.cc/

## How to use it?
Firstly Download the github repositery with git clone `git clone https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/windicsswithnextjs.git` method. then run `npm install or pnpm install` command.

To start the local develpment server run the `pnpm dev or yarn dev` command in terminal. the `windi.config.js` file help add or remove configuration for windi css. In the `_app.js` file i added the css file with `import 'windi.css'` method similare to tailwind css.
